We are a student organization empowering graduate students and post-docs to be more informed and involved in science policy. Our organization seeks to (1) enhance awareness among graduate students in engineering and science disciplines about fellowship and career opportunities in science policy; (2) provide support and resources for graduate students and post-docs pursuing opportunities in science policy; (3) conduct professional development events to prepare graduate students for careers in science policy; (4) facilitate community outreach and advocacy opportunities to increase understanding of scientific research among the community and support evidence-based policies.

## Donate to our Scientists at UVA Covid-19 Community Relief Fundraiser
More than ever, our friends and neighbors in the greater Charlottesville community are turning to local nonprofits to supplement their basic needs.These organizations will face unprecedented demands in coming months to provide food, housing, and health security for tens of thousands of area residents. Local nonprofits anticipate requiring millions of dollars in additional funding to meet community need.

Scientists at UVA have already played a critical role in the COVID-19 response, from developing tests to PPE design and donation. We are offering another way for our community to mobilize in this critical time!

The Science Policy Initiative at UVA (SPI) has partnered with the [*United Way of Greater Charlottesville*](https://www.unitedway.org/local/united-states/virginia/united-way-thomas-jefferson-area), the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation, and others to establish the **Scientists at UVA COVID-19 Community Fund**, an effort to demonstrate our commitment to step up and help local residents as a community at UVA. 

All donations go directly to the [*Community Emergency Response Fund*](https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/cacf-united-way-others-team-up-to-raise-funds-for/article_7108edb8-546f-5651-bbe0-fac1fc7dbed7.html). This is a centralized fund to provide resources to local families with little or no access to emergency funds, now and over the course of this pandemic.
Over the coming months, SPI will continue to raise awareness about the heroic efforts of area nonprofits to ensure that every Charlottesville resident has access to basic needs during the pandemic.

Starting today, our funding goal is $10,000! Track our progress and make a (tax deductible) donation through our [Donate page](donate/){: .btn .btn--success}, and post about it on social media with #UVAScientistsFund and #CvilleEmergencyFund!

Also, we are seeking partnership with other organizations at UVA! Reach out via email or social media if your organization wants to help by promoting and/or donating to this cause.
